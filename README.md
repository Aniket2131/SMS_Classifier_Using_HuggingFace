# SMS_Classifier_Using_HuggingFace

This is the extension of my machine learning project SMS Classifier (which you can in the repository).

This project uses Hugging face transformers for making architecture. The model used in this architecture in istilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english. And the dataset for making the training is available on kaggle with the same name as SMS Classifier.

The tokenizer which we are using is DistilBertTokenizer. 

The training of this model takes a lot of time because of my system configuration. So the training of this model is done on Google collab, below is the image showing the accuracy, validation loss and loss which we get after running for 3 epochs.
